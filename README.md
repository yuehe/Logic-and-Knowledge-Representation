## Project: Programming a syntactical parser in PROLOG and with DCG

The	goal of	this project is	to detect lists	of strings in a	text file. For that	purpose, it is required to	detect,	for	each string, the number	of its occurrences in a	given text.

OTHER NOTES:
- DCG is short for Definite Clause Grammar
